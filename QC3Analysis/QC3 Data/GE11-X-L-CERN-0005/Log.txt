This chamber was initially built with a standard drift and readout planes.
However we have notices quite a large leak rate due to low compression of the O-ring in the corners.
We have therefore added two holes in a new drift and readout board.
We kept the same external frame.

Test 1:
- intial gas leak test, added tape on the screw holes, both top and bottom layers.
